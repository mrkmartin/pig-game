Pig is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die. On each roll, the player can either:
1. Hold: Add their current turn total to their overall score and end their turn.
2. Roll again: Add the new roll to their turn total and continue rolling.

However, if the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn and their turn ends. The first player to reach a predetermined score (often 100) wins.
